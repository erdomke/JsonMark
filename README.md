# JsonMark

JsonMark makes it easier to document and validate JSON schemas by providing turning JSON Schema files into simple, yet complete, Markdown documentation that can be hosted on GitHub or processed using static site generators.

## JSON Schema Support

JsonMark currently supports all keywords defined in [JSON Schema `2020-12`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) except for `$dynamicAnchor` and `$dynamicRef`. Schemas written against other drafts (from `draft-05` onwards) are also supported.

## Installing and running

## Tests

Ensure you have all the dependencies installed via `npm install`, then run:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run the test suite.
