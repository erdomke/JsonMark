# JsonMark

A utility for generating simple, yet complete, Markdown documentation from one or more JSON schemas.

# JSON Schema Markdown Tools

This tool makes it easier to document and validate JSON schemas by providing turning JSON Schema files into simple, yet complete, Markdown documentation that can be hosted on GitHub or processed using static site generators.

## JSON Schema Support

This tool currently supports all keywords defined in [JSON Schema `2020-12`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) except for `$dynamicAnchor` and `$dynamicRef`. Schemas written against other drafts (from `draft-05` onwards) are also supported.
